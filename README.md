# Honeycomb

[Live Demo](https://honeycomb.chummy.fun/)

Honeycomb is an online collaboration solution including notes, spreadsheets, IM, mind maps, and more.

Honeycomb is designed to be a enterprise-level solution for online collaboration, which is also fully open source. 

Small and medium enterprises can deploy their collaboration service within a fraction of minutes, with both the
source code and user data under their control. Large coops or those with ambition can also use Honeycomb as base
to start building on their own, feel free to fork and get your hands dirty.
